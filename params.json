My idea is\r\nbasically to keep a record of everything I learn about Git, partly so\r\nthat I have an easy reference where I can go back to find things, and\r\npartly so that I can help teach other people how to use Git.\r\n\r\nFor example, I've read in the [Pro Git book][pro-git] about [how\r\nreferences work][git-refs], but I don't work with the Git internals\r\noften enough that I easily remember the nitty-gritty details. I\r\nfigure, if I make an effort to write down my research, then I'll\r\nremember it...  or at least, I'll know where to find the answers\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\n**I RESERVE ALL COPYRIGHTS TO THIS WORK**.
