Dear diary, today I started working on my Git Diary project.

Also, I was looking for a way to automatically reformat text to wrap
at 72 columns in a text editor, like in Notepad++ or Sublime Text. I
found a way to do it in Vim: basically, you `:set tw=72`, and then you
select the text you want to reformat, then you type `gq`. See these
links for more info:

* [How to use Vimâ€™s textwidth like a pro](http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/03/vim-textwidth/)
* [How can I wrap text to some length in Vim?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/823754/how-can-i-wrap-text-to-some-length-in-vim/824601#824601)

I also found out that Cygwin's Vim distribution comes with some great
syntax highlighting for Markdown (FYI, it also comes with ***A TON***
of great syntax definitions for other file types too). Msysgit's
distribution of Vim, however, doesn't come with a whole lot of syntax
definitions, though there are neat definitions for Git related stuff,
like rebases.

[MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) is a pretty cool product.
