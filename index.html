<p>This is an experimental side project I'm trying out. My idea is
basically to keep a record of everything I learn about Git, partly so
that I have an easy reference where I can go back to find things, and
partly so that I can help teach other people how to use Git.</p>

<p>For example, I've read in the <a href="http://git-scm.com/book">Pro Git book</a> about <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Internals-Git-References">how
references work</a>, but I don't work with the Git internals
often enough that I easily remember the nitty-gritty details. I
figure, if I make an effort to write down my research, then I'll
remember it...  or at least, I'll know where to find the answers
again.</p>
